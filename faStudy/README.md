# ADI - Food Allergy Study

My motivation for working on the GIS EHR Integration project was to investigate the associations (and potentially causalities) between the Area Deprivation Index and various aspects of Food Allergy diagnosis and treatment. 

As a personal motivation, I have lived with severe food allergies for my entire life, and am still allergic to several foods. I have also been hospitalized with anaphylactic shock several times, most recently last summer. So, I'm grateful to be able to look at food allergies from an academic perspective.

As a research motivation, there has been an observed increase in food allergy rates over the last several decades, faster than genetics alone would explain. Many researchers have sought to study how social, economic, or environmental factors could be explaining this. There has also been a rise in research under the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) umbrella, including some of my fellow research interns this summer. My work over the last summer might be considered as me "getting my feet wet" in the intersection of Food Allergy research and SDOH research.
