# Ayushman Choudhury - BIDS projects, summer 2024

## GIS_EHR Integration
The main purpose of this project was to investigate a pipeline for integrating GIS data (location data for spatial analysis, and location-based data for socio-economic analysis) with our EHR data. 

See the gis_ehr folder for more details.

## Geocoding Comparison
A task related to the above was to select a geocoder â€” either ArcGIS or DeGAUSS. I ran each on subsets of the data, and used both summary tables and manual comparisons to find that ArcGIS would be better for us.

See the geocodingComparison folder for more details.

## Food Allergy/Anaphylaxis study
I used the GIS_EHR integration to study the links between Area Deprivation Index (a Census-Block-Group metric of socio-economic deprivation) and the rate/outcomes of Food Allergy / Food Anaphylaxis events. 

See the faStudy folder for more details.
